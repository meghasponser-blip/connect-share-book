- Expose home stories through one pointer-draggable floating button; keep the position within viewport bounds and distinguish dragging from tapping.
- Keep sample content in an explicit local fixture module, visibly labeled Demo, and never write sample interactions to real accounts.
- Render the floating story control and viewer in body portals so surrounding page elements cannot clip them.
- Keep profile people lists in ConnectionsList and connection actions in ConnectButton; shared query invalidation keeps counts and lists consistent after actions.
